---==[ GDB tips ]==---

Notice the "disassemble" and "stepi" commands.

You may find the "x" command useful to examine memory (and the
different ways you can print the contents such as "/a" "/i"
after "x"). The "info register" command is helpful in printing
out the contents of registers such as ebp and esp.

A useful way to run gdb is to use the -e and -s command line flags;
for example, the command "gdb -e sploit3 -s /tmp/target3" in the VM
tells gdb to execute sploit3 and use the symbol file in target3.
These flags let you trace the execution of the target3 after the
sploit's memory image has been replaced with the target's through the
execve system call.

When running gdb using these command line flags, you should follow
the following procedure for setting breakpoints and debugging memory:

1. tell gdb to notify you on exec(), by issuing the command "catch
   exec"
2. run the program.  gdb will execute the sploit until the execve
   syscall, then return control to you
3. set any breakpoints you want in the target
4. resume execution by telling gdb "continue" (or just "c").

If you try to set breakpoints before the exec boundary, you will
get a segfault.

If you wish, you can instrument the target code with arbitrary
assembly using the __asm__ () pseudofunction, to help with debugging.
Be sure, however, that your final exploits work against the unmodified
targets, since these we will use these in grading.
