Sploit 2 works with having an input string that is concatenated with a comma.  The first part of the parameter was a value that would have strtoul called on it.  Since the function returns a signed int, passing in a value large enough was needed in order to cause an overflow as well as passing the (count < MAX_WIDGETS) length check.  The value would need to be large enough to int overflow the variable count so it would appear to be a negative number, but also be able to be multiplied by the struct size in order to produce a value that would be able to buffer overflow without faulting since the value was too big.
